1. Network Configuration

- Topology & Configuration

The system follows a client-server model: end users connect to the web server (hosting the PHP/HTML/JS code) over HTTPS, and the server communicates with a MySQL database on the same or a nearby host.

- Security Measures

The hosting provider or control panel environment typically provides a firewall. You enforce HTTPS to encrypt traffic (e.g., using an SSL certificate).

Database access is restricted to the local server or specific IP addresses.

- Protocols & Communication

Front-end calls are over HTTPS to your PHP endpoints.

PHP uses MySQLi or PDO to talk to the MySQL database.

2.  Deployment & Infrastructure

- Deployment Strategies

deployed to a shared hosting or a control-panel-based environment 

You can push code via FTP, SFTP, or a Git deployment mechanism.

- Hardware Specs & Server Config

Typically runs on a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).

- Configuration Management

Basic environment variables or a config file (e.g., db.php) store database credentials and site settings.

- Scalability & Resource Optimization

Basic caching (e.g., PHP opcache) or query optimization in MySQL.

If usage grows, you could move to a VPS or cloud-based environment, separate database from web server, and implement caching or horizontal scaling.

3. Security Measures

- Security Protocols & Measures

SSL/TLS for all web traffic (HTTPS).

Strict firewall rules to prevent direct external DB connections.

Use prepared statements in PHP to prevent SQL injection.

- Authentication & Authorization

User login uses password_hash() and password_verify().

Session-based authentication (PHP sessions) or tokens for API calls.

Role-based logic: “Admin” vs. “Employee” privileges.

- Encryption & Data Protection

Passwords are stored as salted hashes (no plain-text).

Sensitive data in transit is protected by HTTPS.

Access to the hosting control panel is limited to admin credentials.

- Incident Response & Mitigation

If a breach is detected, you can reset credentials, rotate DB passwords, and restore from backups.

Logs can help identify suspicious activity.

4. System Monitoring & Maintenance

- Tools & Techniques

Basic error logs in Apache/PHP.

Some hosting panels offer resource usage graphs (CPU, RAM).

You might add an external uptime monitor (e.g., UptimeRobot).

- Logging & Error Handling

Application-level logs: track authentication attempts, payroll generation, errors.

Possibly log to a separate file or DB table if needed.

- Handling Updates

Typically done via cPanel or FTP to push new PHP files.

Database schema updates might use phpMyAdmin or migration scripts.

- Disaster Recovery & Backup

The hosting environment usually has daily or weekly backups.

MySQL backups can be taken via phpMyAdmin or scheduled tasks.

You can also do manual exports or store backups offsite.

5. API & Integration Points

- Documentation of APIs

If external systems integrate (e.g., for HR or accounting), you’d define endpoints (like getEmployeeInfo.php, getPayslips.php) returning JSON.

- Endpoints, Methods, Data Formats

Typically POST or GET to PHP scripts, returning JSON.

Standard REST-like patterns: php/getEmployeeInfo.php?id=123.

- Integration with External Systems

For advanced features (e.g., external payroll providers), the system might offer a secure token-based API or a direct database read under strict access.
